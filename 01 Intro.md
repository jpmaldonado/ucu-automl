## Why AutoML?

AutoML serves two purposes:

- **For ML experts:**
	- Replace the domain knowledge/feature engineering.
	- Reduce function evaluations in cases when it is expensive (robotics, reinforcement learning).
- **For non-ML experts**
	- Make machine learning available.
	- Eliminate manual tuning by adequate testing.

## The usual caveat

- **Garbage in, garbage out**.
- Complexities of many real-world data scenarios DO NOT DISAPPEAR MAGICALLY by using an AutoML system.
- Likely to work better on *consistently generated data*, usually not the type of data you find in a normal CRM/ERP system.
